### Description

Fractal Studio is a fractal generator. It generates nice pictures using mathematical formulae and different filters.

If you don't know what a fractal is, there's plenty of information on the net. A simple search should return lots of tutorials.

Please notice:

This is an alpha version, and is likely to contain some (probably a lot of) bugs/features.

There's still a lot to be implemented, I only submit this at this point to get some feedback.

If you have any suggestions as to how I could improve the user interface, feel free to mail me at erlinga@stud.ntnu.no. I'd appreciate it.

Bug reports can be sent to the above adress, too.

There's a readme-file included in the zip that I suggest you read - I'm afraid the user interface isn't very intuitive yet.

---

Hope you enjoy exploring the fractals!

Erling
